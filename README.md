# Project One: Metropolitan Transportation Authority

In this project we explore public data provided by the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). Our goal is to consult WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) on their street canvassing strategy targeting subway stations in NYC. Their street teams will work to build awareness and reach by gathering signatures and commitments to attend their gala aimed at increasing the participation of women in technology. We will quantify optimal locations based on station traffic, time series patterns, and demographic data provided by the United States Census. 

We will consider MTA turnstile data from August 3rd, 2019 to October 3rd, 2019 as the appropriate window before their Fall 2020 gala. This data is filtered to remove errors and inconsistencies in the reporting process. During our designated time frame, we analyze the busiest stations, weekday traffic, and daily time trends.
